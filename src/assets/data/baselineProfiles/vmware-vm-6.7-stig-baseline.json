Find the RemoteDisplay.vnc.enabled value and set it to false. If\nthe setting does not exist, add the Name and Value setting at the bottom of\nscreen.\n\nNote: The VM must be powered off to configure the advanced settings through the\nvSphere Web Client so it is recommended to configure these settings with\nPowerCLI as it can be done while the VM is powered on. Settings do not take\neffect via either method until the virtual machine is cold started, not\nrebooted.\n\nor\n\nFrom a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the ESXi host or vCenter\nserver, run the following command:\n\nIf the setting does not exist, run:\n\nGet-VM \\\"VM Name\\\" | New-AdvancedSetting -Name RemoteDisplay.vnc.enabled -Value\nfalse\n\nIf the setting exists, run:\n\nGet-VM \\\"VM Name\\\" | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name RemoteDisplay.vnc.enabled |\nSet-AdvancedSetting -Value false\"\n\n  command = \"(Get-VM -Name #{input('vmName')} | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name RemoteDisplay.vnc.enabled).value\"\n  describe powercli_command(command).stdout.strip do\n    it { should cmp \"false\" }\n  end\n\nend\n",
