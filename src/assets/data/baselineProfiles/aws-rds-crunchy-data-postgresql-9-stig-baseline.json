        "default": "Security flaws with software applications, including database\n  management systems, are discovered daily. Vendors are constantly updating and\n  patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities.\n  Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to\n  promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service\n  packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments,\n  continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system\n  error handling must also be addressed expeditiously.  Organization-defined\n  time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a\n  variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the\n  information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the\n  vulnerability related to the discovered flaw).  This requirement will apply\n  to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across\n  the enclave and also to applications themselves that are not part of that p\n  atch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the\n  capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as\n  system criticality, will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding\n  the patch management process will also vary. This means that the time period\n  utilized must be a configurable parameter. Time frames for application of\n  security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the Information\n  Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process.  The application will\n  be configured to check for and install security-relevant software updates\n  within an identified time period from the availability of the update. The\n  specific time period will be defined by an authoritative source (e.g., IAVM,\n  CTOs, DTMs, and STIGs)."
