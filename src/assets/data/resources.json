Consider types of Cloud Services, Virtualization Platforms, Operating Systems, Databases, Application Logic, and Web Servers.</p><h4 class=\"mb-2\"> Step 2: What can be hardened using CMS SAF?</h4><p class=\"ml-4\">See our <a href=\"https://saf.cms.gov/#/implementation\"> CMS SAF Implementation/Hardening page</a> for scripts to automatically harden the system components you identified in Step 1 every time you build or fix them.</p><h4 class=\"mb-2\">Step 3: What can be validated using CMS SAF?</h4><p class=\"ml-4\">See our <a href=\"https://saf.cms.gov/#/validation\" target=\"_blank\">CMS SAF Validation page</a> for scripts to automatically validate the security of your system components identified in Step 1 every time you build or fix them.</p><h4 class=\"mb-2\">Step 4: Decide how to integrate the hardening and validation runners into your specific workflow.</h4><p class=\"ml-4\">Depending on how you develop and operate your system, be it traditional administrative servers or DevOps orchestration pipelines, you can decide where it makes the most sense to stage the hardening (Kitchen, Ansible, Terraform, Puppet, etc) and validation (InSpec) runners for the scripts identified in Steps 2 and 3 (See graphic below on the many ways InSpec can be installed).<p><h4 class=\"mb-2\">Step 5: What Static and Dynamic Code Analysis Tools are you using?</h4><p class=\"ml-4\">See our <a href=\"https://saf.cms.gov/#/faq#tools\" target=\"_blank\">Heimdall_tools page</a> to find code to convert the output from common Static and Dynamic Code Analysis Tools into the CMS ISPG standard Heimdall Data Format (HDF). HDF security validation data can be visualized for analysis using Heimdall Lite or Heimdall Server (more on those in Step 6!).</p><h4 class=\"mb-2\">Step 6: Visualize and start fixing!</h4><p class=\"ml-4\">Use <a href=\"https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Heimdall Lite</a> or your own <a href=\"https://heimdall.mitre.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Heimdall Server</a> to visualize and identify remediation steps in the output from InSpec (Step 3 Validation) and Heimdall_tools (Step 5). <a href=\"https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Heimdall Lite</a> is a single-page browser-based solution, while <a href=\"https://heimdall.mitre.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Heimdall Server</a> provides your team with its own back-end database for storing security validation data and more! Both allow the user to ingest security validation data via a GUI, the API, Splunk, or S3!</p><h4 class=\"mb-2\">Step 7: Give us feedback!</h4><p class=\"ml-4\">If you donâ€™t see a hardening script, validation script, or security tool converter you need here, click on the \"Give Us Feedback\" button in the header above and let us know your interest!</p><p class=\"ml-4\">Want more context? The steps above embrace the best practices cited below. We also provide more perspective below on InSpec, the core CMS SAF tool for automated security configuration validation.</p>"
