{ "content": "<h2>About CMS SAF Training</h2><p> InSpec is an open-source and precise scripting framework to help you test the functionality and security of your systems. Many profiles are available as part of the open source community, with CMS-tailored profiles located on our <router-link to=\"/validation\">Validation</router-link>page. Due to the intuitive nature of the InSpec language, developers and security professionals can spend less time debating about <i>how</i> to test, and more time solving problems using the <a href=\"https://heimdall-lite.cms.gov/\" target=\"_blank\"  >Heimdall Lite</a > or <a href=\"https://github.com/mitre/heimdall\" target=\"_blank\"  >Heimdall Server</a > visualization tools.</p><p> While using existing InSpec profiles is great, tailoring and creating new profiles helps to increase the precision and relevance of security testing for your environment, and helps to streamline the ATO process. ISPG has a process for peer review and vetting of your tailored profiles <a  href=\"CMS_InSpec_Profile_Lifecycle_SOP_v1.0_20190702.pdf\"  download  >here.</a ></p><p> Our partners at MITRE offer regular InSpec training courses.
