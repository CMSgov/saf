    <h2>RSVP – InSpec profile developer training for March/April 2021!</h2>

      Sponsored by CMS under the CMS Security Automation Framework, we’re happy

      A note on prerequisites: For the basic class, knowledge of basic
      programming concepts, modern language conventions and some working
      experience with a modern language (e.g., Ruby, Python, Go, etc) is useful.
      (Inspec is a Ruby Domain-specific language (DSL)). To become more familiar
      with Ruby, feel free to review the following Ruby primers. For the
      follow-on advanced class (basic is a preferred prerequisite), we'll be
      writing InSpec Resources in the Ruby language, so it is highly recommended
      students of the advanced class unfamiliar with Ruby review the following
      Ruby primers
