# CMS customizations based on MITRE's Security Automation Framework (CMS SAF)

# **PLEASE NOTE: **[MITRE SAF](https://saf.mitre.org/)**** continues as an open-source shared community.

CMS’ ISPG (Information Security and Privacy Group) decided to **discontinue funding it’s own CMS customizations** based on [MITRE’s Security Automation Framework (SAF)](https://saf.mitre.org/) for CMS after September 2023.

Existing CMS-tailored Security Validation (InSpec Profile) content will still be available on [Github](https://security.cms.gov/learn/security-automation-framework-saf), as well as the other open-source tools provided on the [MITRE SAF website](https://saf.mitre.org/): 

- [Baseline (to STIG or CIS) Security Validation InSpec profiles](https://saf.mitre.org/libs/validate)
- [SAF Data Converter and Attestation tools](https://saf-cli.mitre.org/)
- [Heimdall Lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org/) and [Server Security Data visualizer](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2)
- CMS-format CAAT spreadsheet export via Heimdall and SAF-CLI.
